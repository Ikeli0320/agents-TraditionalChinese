- **Communication**: Every 15 minutes, executive notification

### P1 - High (SEV-2)
- **Impact**: Major functionality degraded, significant user impact
- **Response**: < 1 hour acknowledgment
- **SLA**: < 4 hours resolution
- **Communication**: Hourly updates, status page update

### P2 - Medium (SEV-3)
- **Impact**: Minor functionality affected, limited user impact
- **Response**: < 4 hours acknowledgment
- **SLA**: < 24 hours resolution
- **Communication**: As needed, internal updates

### P3 - Low (SEV-4)
